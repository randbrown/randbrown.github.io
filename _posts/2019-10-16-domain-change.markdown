# I Changed Domain Names

I haven't published in a while.  Got pretty busy with life.  My old randbrown.site domain name expired, and I decided to switch over to the new randbrown.com instead.  

# What I've Been Up To

I haven't done a whole lot of coding for fun recently. I've been concentrating on making music digitally. 

* I've been learning the [REAPER DAW](https://www.reaper.fm/)
* I've created a few new songs and put them on [my soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/randbrown)
* I've been re-recording some old metal songs from my Labyrinth days.  I have not published any of them yet, but [here are some of the originals](https://soundcloud.com/labyrinth-metal)
* I've been learning [Superior Drummer](https://www.toontrack.com/product/superior-drummer-3/)
